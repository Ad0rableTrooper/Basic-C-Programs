# Basic-C-Programs
This is my college C Programming Class Repository. Here I mostly write codes, either given by the lecturer or some of the program made by myself

## Repository Contents
- **.vscode**: This folder is sort of a cache folder, made by Visual Studio Code, while building and running the C Program.

- **Executable Files**: This folder contains the machine code, which can be run directly.

- **LICENSE**: This file contains the Terms and Conditions regarding distributing and reproducing the given repository

- **README**: This file contains this, XD.

> You can also add your programms and publish in this Repository
